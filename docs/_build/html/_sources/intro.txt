Introduction
==============

nfelib helps to process XML instance documents that obey the
nfe XML schema.

With nfelib (nfelib.py) you can write
Python code to:

- Parse an XML document that obeys the nfe XML schema,
  creating instances of the Python classes that represent the types
  defined in the nfe schema.  These Python classes are
  defined in nfelib.py.

- Create instances of classes that represent the types described in
  the nfe XML schema.

- Write Python application code that uses the classes that
  represent nfe types.

- Export the objects to an XML document.


Schemas
---------

The nfelib.py module in this package was generated from the
XML schemas in ./schemas.


generateDS.py
---------------

The nfelib.py module in this package was generated by
generateDS.py.  You can learn about generateDS.py here:
